# Stream One project

## Overview

This is my Stream One Project for [Code Institute](http://codeinstitute.net). We have to build a static (front-end only) website for either a band or a topic of our choosing.
The website must consist of 4-5 pages and use the technologies we have learnt in stream one.
I have chosen to build a static website based on the Back to the Future franchise. The purpose of the website is to inform users of the film.

## Features

### Existing Features
- None at present

### Features left to Implement
- Information about the film such as:
	- Cast
	- trailers
	- reviews
- Timeline to show the order of events throughout the film.
- Trivia
- Where to rent or purchase the film
- Contact form so that users can get in touch to either show appreciation or contribute to the facts.

## Tech Used

I have used the following to create the website:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
	- I have used a custom **JavaScript** logic so that there is an interactive element to the website.
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
	- I have used **Bootstrap** as it offers a simple layout with responsive design.
- [jQuery](http://code.jquery.com/)
	- **jQuery** is referenced in order for the **Bootstrap** setup to work.

## Contributing
At present any requests to contribute will be denied as this project has to be completed solely by me.
