								</h4>
								<p>
									At Hill Valley, California, Marty McFly goes to a utility shed until receiving a phone call from Dr. Emmett Brown, 
									realizing that he is late for school. At Hill Valley High School, Marty meets his girlfriend, Jennifer Parker, 
									and both are confronted by Mr. Strickland for showing up late. Marty attempts to audition for Battle of the Bands, 
									but is rejected for being "too darn loud". Marty goes home, where his father, George, is bullied by his supervisor, 
									Biff Tannen, while his mother Lorraine is an overweight, depressed alcoholic. Lorraine recalls one night, 
									she met George when her father hit him with a car. 
								</p>
								<p>
									On October 26, 1985, Marty meets Doc at a shopping mall parking lot in the early morning hours. 
									Doc unveils a time machine built from a modified DeLorean and powered by plutonium stolen from Libyan terrorists. 
									Doc demonstrates the time navigation system by setting the date to November 5, 1955: the day he invented time travel. 
									A moment later, the Libyans arrive and shoot Doc. Marty escapes in the DeLorean, but inadvertently activates the time machine, 
									traveling to 1955 without enough plutonium to return. 
								</p>
								<p>
									There, Marty encounters the teenaged George, who is bullied by his classmate Biff. 
									After Marty saves George from an oncoming car and is knocked unconscious, he awakens to find himself tended to by an infatuated 
									Lorraine. Marty leaves and tracks down Doc's younger self to help him return to 1985. With no plutonium, 
									Doc explains that the only power source capable of generating the necessary 1.21 gigawatts of electricity for the time machine 
									is a bolt of lightning. Marty shows Doc a flyer from the future that recounts a lightning strike at the town's courthouse 
									the coming Saturday night. Doc instructs Marty to not leave his house or interact with anyone, as he could inadvertently change 
									the course of history and alter the future; because of this, Doc refuses to heed warnings from Marty about his death in 1985. 
									Marty realizes that he has prevented his parents from meeting, and Doc warns Marty that he will be erased from existence if he 
									does not find a way to introduce George to Lorraine. Doc formulates a plan to harness the power of the lightning while Marty 
									sets about introducing his parents, but he antagonizes Biff and his gang in the process.
								</p>
								<p>
									When Lorraine asks Marty to the upcoming school dance, Marty concocts a plan for George to "rescue" her from his feigned 
									inappropriate advances. The plan goes awry when a drunken Biff attempts to force himself on Lorraine. George arrives to 
									rescue her from Marty, but finds Biff instead. George knocks out Biff and Lorraine follows George to the dance floor, 
									where they kiss and fall in love while Marty plays music with the band. Satisfied that he has secured his future existence, 
									Marty leaves to meet Doc.
								</p>
								<p>
									As the storm arrives, Marty returns to the clock tower and the lightning strikes on cue, 
									sending Marty back to October 1985. He finds that Doc is not dead, as he had listened to Marty's warnings, and worn a 
									bullet-proof vest. Doc takes Marty home, then departs.
								</p>
								<p>
									Marty awakens the next morning to discover some changes: George is a self-confident, successful author, Lorraine is physically 
									fit and happy, his brother David is a successful businessman, his sister Linda works in a boutique and has many "boyfriends" 
									and Biff is now an obsequious auto valet. As Marty reunites with Jennifer, the DeLorean appears with Doc, dressed in a 
									futuristic outfit, insisting they accompany him to 2015 to resolve a problem with their future children. 
									The trio board the DeLorean and warp to the future.

									<p>
										On October 26, 1985, Dr. Emmett Brown arrives in the DeLorean time machine and persuades Marty McFly and his girlfriend, 
										Jennifer Parker, to travel to the future with him, and help their future children. Biff Tannen witnesses their departure. 
										They arrive on October 21, 2015, where Doc electronically knocks out Jennifer, and leaves her asleep in an alley, 
										explaining that she should not have too much knowledge of future events. He has Marty pose as his own son and lookalike 
										Marty Jr. to refuse an offer to participate in a robbery with Biff's grandson Griff, thus saving both of Marty's children 
										from prison.
									</p>
									<p>
										Marty switches places with Marty Jr. and refuses Griff's offer, but Griff goads Marty into a fight. 
										Griff and his gang are arrested, saving Marty's future children. Before rejoining Doc, Marty purchases an almanac, 
										containing the results of major sporting events from 1950 to 2000. Doc discovers it and warns Marty about attempting to 
										profit from time travel, but before Doc can adequately dispose of it, they are interrupted by the police, who have found 
										Jennifer incapacitated, and are taking her to her 2015 home. They pursue, as does Biff, who has overheard their conversation, 
										and picked up the almanac that Doc discarded.
									</p>
									<p>
										Jennifer wakes up in her 2015 home and hides from the McFly family. She overhears that her future self's life with Marty is not what she expected, 
										due to his involvement in an automobile accident. She witnesses Marty being goaded by his co-worker, Douglas J. Needles, into a shady business deal, 
										which leads to Marty's firing. Attempting to escape the house, Jennifer encounters her 2015 self and they both faint. While Marty and Doc attend to her, 
										Biff steals the time machine and uses it to travel back to 1955 and give the almanac to his younger self to get rich betting, then returns to 2015. Marty, 
										Doc, and an unconscious Jennifer return to 1985, unaware of Biff's actions.	
									</p>
									<p>
										The 1985 they return to has altered: Biff has become wealthy and corrupt, and has changed Hill Valley into a chaotic dystopia. 
										Marty's father, George, was killed in 1973 and Biff has forced Marty's mother, Lorraine, to marry him. Doc has been committed to an insane asylum. 
										Marty and Doc determine that the 2015 Biff took the time machine to change 1985, and Marty learns from the alternate 1985 Biff that he got the almanac on 
										November 12, 1955. Biff attempts to confront Marty, but Marty flees and returns to 1955 with Doc, leaving Jennifer on her own front porch.
									</p>
									<p>
										Marty secretly follows the 1955 Biff, and watches him receive the almanac from his 2015 self. Marty then follows him to the high school's dance, 
										being careful to avoid interrupting the events from his previous visit. Marty and the 1955 Biff steal the almanac back and forth, but Marty and 
										Doc retrieve it, until Biff crashes into a manure truck. Marty burns the almanac, reversing Biff's changes to the timeline, as Doc hovers above in 
										the time machine. Before Marty can join him inside, the DeLorean is struck by lightning, and disappears. A Western Union courier immediately arrives 
										and delivers a letter to Marty; it is from Doc, who explains that he was transported back to 1885. Marty races back into town to find the 1955 Doc, 
										who had just helped the original Marty return to 1985. Shocked by Marty's sudden reappearance, Doc faints.

									<p>
										On November 12, 1955, Marty McFly discovers that his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown, is now trapped in 1885. Marty and Doc's 1955 self use the information in Doc's 
										1885 letter to locate and repair the DeLorean. Marty spots a tombstone with Doc's name, dated six days after the letter, learning that Doc was killed by Biff 
										Tannen's great-grandfather, Buford Tannen. Marty takes a picture of the tombstone and travels back to 1885 to save Doc.
									</p>
									<p>
										Marty arrives on September 2, 1885, in the middle of a Cavalry pursuit of Indians. When the fuel line is torn, Marty hides the car in a cave and walks to Hill 
										Valley. He meets his Irish-born great-great-grandparents, Seamus and Maggie McFly, and runs afoul of Buford and his gang. Buford tries to hang Marty, but Doc 
										rescues him. Doc agrees to leave 1885, but because commercial gasoline is not yet available, the DeLorean cannot reach 88 miles per hour under its own power.
									</p>
									<p>
										Doc devises a plan to use a locomotive to push the DeLorean up to the required speed. While he and Marty explore a rail spur they intend to use, they spot a 
										horse-drawn wagon going amok. Doc saves the passenger, Clara Clayton, and the two fall in love. Marty thwarts Buford's attempt to kill Doc at a town festival, 
										whereupon Buford challenges Marty to a showdown in two days. Doc's name disappears from the photograph of his tombstone, but the date remains unchanged; Doc 
										warns Marty that he might be the one killed by Buford.
									</p>
									<p>
										The night before their departure, Marty and Doc place the DeLorean onto the rail spur. Unable to convince Clara the truth that he is from the future, Doc is 
										spurned. Doc returns to the town saloon for a binge, but Marty goes to the saloon, and convinces Doc to leave with him. Doc drinks a single shot of whiskey 
										and passes out. Buford arrives early and calls out Marty, but Marty refuses to duel. Doc revives after drinking the bartender's special "Wake-Up Juice" and 
										tries fleeing with Marty, but Buford's gang captures Doc, forcing Marty to duel. During a fistfight, Buford destroys the tombstone, is knocked unconscious 
										into a wagon full of manure, and is then arrested for an earlier robbery. Marty and Doc depart to steal the locomotive.

										As Clara is leaving on the train, she overhears a salesman discussing how heartbroken Doc was at the saloon. Clara applies the emergency brake and goes back 
										to town. She discovers Doc's model of the time machine and rides after him. Having stolen the train at gunpoint, Doc and Marty begin pushing the DeLorean along 
										the spur line, attempting to get it up to 88 miles per hour. Clara boards the locomotive, while Doc climbs towards the DeLorean. Doc encourages Clara to join him. 
										As she climbs to Doc, Clara falls and hangs by her dress. Marty passes his 2015-era hoverboard to Doc so he can save Clara. They coast away from the train as 
										Marty returns alone to 1985 while the locomotive falls off the unfinished bridge.

										Marty arrives on October 27, 1985, escaping the powerless DeLorean before it is destroyed by an oncoming freight train. He discovers that everything has returned 
										to the improved timeline, and finds Jennifer sleeping on her front porch. He uses the lessons he learned in 1885 to avoid being goaded into a street race with 
										Douglas J. Needles, avoiding a possible automobile accident. Remembering that this accident would have sent Marty's life spiraling downward by 2015, Jennifer 
										opens a fax message she kept from 2015, and watches as its text regarding Marty's firing disappears.
									</p>
									<p>
										As Marty and Jennifer witness the time machine wreckage, a locomotive equipped with a flux capacitor appears, manned by Doc, Clara, and their two children Jules 
										and Verne. Doc gives Marty a photo of the two of them by the clockworks at the 1885 festival. Jennifer asks about the fax, and Doc tells them it means that the 
										future has not been written yet. Doc’s then departs and the train disappears into an unknown time.
