				<!--<p>The timeline below points out major points in the movies in the chronological order that they happened</p>-->
				<p>
					The timeline below is only a brief timeline to give you an idea of the order of events, some of the times I have estimated as the specific times
					are not made apparent in the movies. I have taken the timeline information from the <a href="http://backtothefuture.wikia.com/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_timeline" target="_blank">Back to the Future wiki</a>, 
					which I would checkout for a more complete explanation of the timeline(s).
