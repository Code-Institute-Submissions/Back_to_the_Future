# Stream One Project: Back to the Future Website.

## Overview

### What is this website for?

This is my Stream One project for [Code Institue](https://www.codeinstitute.net/). The website is a fan website for the film trilogy "Back to the Future".

### What does the website allow users to do?

The website allows users to view film information such as the plot, trailers, reviews etc. There is also an interactive timeline that shows what I have deemed the most important dates in the film trilogy. There is also a contact form that users can interact with however there is no backend for this so the form data doesn't get sent anywhere.

### How does it work?

The website is built with HTML for the structure, CSS and Bootstrap for the styling, Javascript to validate the contact form and Vis for the timeline.

## Features

## Tech Used

- HTML5
    - This provides the basic layout of the webpage.
- CSS3
    - I have used this to style certain elements on the sites pages.
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
    - I have used bootstrap to give my website a clean and responsive layout.
- JavaScript
    - This has been used to provide form validation on the contact form to ensure that users get a response when they haven't filled in part of the form. This is also used in Vis.js.
- [Vis.js](http://visjs.org/index.html)
    - This library was used for creating the timeline.
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
    - This is used in conjunction with Bootstrap.
