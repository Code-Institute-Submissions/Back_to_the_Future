									<strong>Warning this section contains spoilers!</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									At Hill Valley, California, Marty McFly goes to a utility shed until receiving a phone call from Dr. Emmett Brown, 
									realizing that he is late for school. At Hill Valley High School, Marty meets his girlfriend, Jennifer Parker, 
									and both are confronted by Mr. Strickland for showing up late. Marty attempts to audition for Battle of the Bands, 
									but is rejected for being "too darn loud". Marty goes home, where his father, George, is bullied by his supervisor, 
									Biff Tannen, while his mother Lorraine is an overweight, depressed alcoholic. Lorraine recalls one night, 
									she met George when her father hit him with a car. 
								</p>
								<p>
									On October 26, 1985, Marty meets Doc at a shopping mall parking lot in the early morning hours. 
									Doc unveils a time machine built from a modified DeLorean and powered by plutonium stolen from Libyan terrorists. 
									Doc demonstrates the time navigation system by setting the date to November 5, 1955: the day he invented time travel. 
									A moment later, the Libyans arrive and shoot Doc. Marty escapes in the DeLorean, but inadvertently activates the time machine, 
									traveling to 1955 without enough plutonium to return. 
								</p>
								<p>
									There, Marty encounters the teenaged George, who is bullied by his classmate Biff. 
									After Marty saves George from an oncoming car and is knocked unconscious, he awakens to find himself tended to by an infatuated 
									Lorraine. Marty leaves and tracks down Doc's younger self to help him return to 1985. With no plutonium, 
									Doc explains that the only power source capable of generating the necessary 1.21 gigawatts of electricity for the time machine 
									is a bolt of lightning. Marty shows Doc a flyer from the future that recounts a lightning strike at the town's courthouse 
									the coming Saturday night. Doc instructs Marty to not leave his house or interact with anyone, as he could inadvertently change 
									the course of history and alter the future; because of this, Doc refuses to heed warnings from Marty about his death in 1985. 
									Marty realizes that he has prevented his parents from meeting, and Doc warns Marty that he will be erased from existence if he 
									does not find a way to introduce George to Lorraine. Doc formulates a plan to harness the power of the lightning while Marty 
									sets about introducing his parents, but he antagonizes Biff and his gang in the process.
								</p>
								<p>
									When Lorraine asks Marty to the upcoming school dance, Marty concocts a plan for George to "rescue" her from his feigned 
									inappropriate advances. The plan goes awry when a drunken Biff attempts to force himself on Lorraine. George arrives to 
									rescue her from Marty, but finds Biff instead. George knocks out Biff and Lorraine follows George to the dance floor, 
									where they kiss and fall in love while Marty plays music with the band. Satisfied that he has secured his future existence, 
									Marty leaves to meet Doc.
								</p>
								<p>
									As the storm arrives, Marty returns to the clock tower and the lightning strikes on cue, 
									sending Marty back to October 1985. He finds that Doc is not dead, as he had listened to Marty's warnings, and worn a 
									bullet-proof vest. Doc takes Marty home, then departs.
								</p>
								<p>
									Marty awakens the next morning to discover some changes: George is a self-confident, successful author, Lorraine is physically 
									fit and happy, his brother David is a successful businessman, his sister Linda works in a boutique and has many "boyfriends" 
									and Biff is now an obsequious auto valet. As Marty reunites with Jennifer, the DeLorean appears with Doc, dressed in a 
									futuristic outfit, insisting they accompany him to 2015 to resolve a problem with their future children. 
									The trio board the DeLorean and warp to the future.
